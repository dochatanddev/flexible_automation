# Flexible Automation (minetest mod)

## What the mod does:
Mod adds 3 things:
1. refTaker tool (id `flexible_automation:reftaker`)
1. refNode (id `flexible_automation:refnode`)
1. filter (id `flexible_automation:filter`)

## How to use these things?
Use refTaker to take refNode (basically a link to that block
in a form of new block).
Example: use refTaker on 2 different chests. Place 
refNodes of these chests somewhere and use filter
to transfer items between refNodes. See that by
doing that you do moving items between chests.
